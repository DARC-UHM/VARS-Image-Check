1. Add records for external review via the `Add to external review` popup menu. The dropdown menu lists external reviewers that match the current record's phylum.
   1. If the reviewer you want to add is not on the list, select `See all reviewers`. A new tab will open that allows you to view and edit external reviewer information. Changes here are saved to the external reviewer database.

   2. The `Delete from external review` button will remove the record from the external review database (the record will remain in the VARS database). The `Added for review` comment will be automatically deleted.
   3. The `Reviewer comments` section will display comments that the external reviewer has saved along with a timestamp of when the comment was written.
4. Once all records have been added for an external reviewer, they can access their review page at http://hurlstor.soest.hawaii.edu:5000/review/REVIEWER-NAME (spaces or dashes between first/last names are both okay).
